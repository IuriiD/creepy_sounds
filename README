General idea:
Invocation: Ok, Google! Talk to Creepy Sounds!

Every bot's response begins with a creepy sound (monsters/zombie etc) and then some child cry is 
played in a long loop (for eg., 40sec * 15times = 600sec/10min)

The only intent is 



bot is playing some kids cry/screem sounds and when it gets some input (either everythin to Default Fallback intent or with some differentiation to intents) it suddenly plays some creepy sounds
