A primitive Google Action for Halloween 2018 celebration at MOC.
The Dialogflow agent has only 2 intents, creepysounds.input.welcome and default.intent
Both gave same output - a random sound from Google's sound library (https://developers.google.com/actions/tools/sound-library/horror)

Initially I wanted the bot to play a horror sound and then some kids cry until the next user's input but it looks like the bot doesn't accept new input until the record is playing.
Also if user fails to say something during the time when microphone is 'listening' then he/she has to say 'Ok Google' before saying the next phrase.
